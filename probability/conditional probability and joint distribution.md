# Disease/Quality Test
A laboratory blood test is 95 percent effective in detecting a
certain disease when it is, in fact, present. However, the test also yields a “false
positive” result for 1 percent of the healthy persons tested. (That is, if a healthy
person is tested, then, with probability 0.01, the test result will imply he has the
disease.) If 0.5 percent of the population actually has the disease, what is the
probability a person has the disease given that his test result is positive?
Answer\
$(0.95*0.005)/[(0.95+0.005)+(0.01)(0.995)]=95/294$
